    <p>If you don't have Python installed on your computer, go ahead and install it now.
        If your operating system does not provide you with a Python package, you can download
        an installer from the Python official website. If you are using Microsoft Windows
        along with WSL or Cygwin, note that you will not be using the Windows native version
        of Python, but a Unix-friendly version that you need to obtain from Ubuntu
        (if you are using WSL) or from Cygwin
    </p>
